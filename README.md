# Salamaa
This holds the current iteration of Salamaa, a text-based adventure game.

The entire game is written in Java. Salamaa is a personal project of mine
that began before I could even code in Java, and I have been working on
it as my experience with Java has developed. The game currently employs
a GUI, and is about three-fifths comlete. A future plan for the game is to
add sound, though the possibility for graphics is slim due to conflict with
the general spirit of a text-based game. 

The primary classes for the game are held in the A_Main package. Any class that
is a parent class is held in the A_Super package. Interfaces and enums are held
there too. All other packages represent rooms.
