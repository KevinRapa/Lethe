# Salamaa
This holds the current iteration of Salamaa, a text-based adventure game.

The entire game is written in Java. Salamaa is a personal project of mine
that began before I could even code in Java, and I have been working on
it as my experience with Java has developed. The game currently employs
a GUI, and is about three-fifths complete. 

The game employs a save feature using serialization, a Swing GUI, sound, and 
heavy regex usage.

The primary classes for the game are held in the A_Main package. Any class that
is a parent class is held in the A_Super package. Interfaces and enums are held
there too. All other packages represent rooms.
