To play, just run Lethe.jar. Make sure to keep the .jar executable 
together with the data folder You may move the shortcut wherever you'd like, of course.

Make sure you have the latest version of Java when running.
This application requires a screen resolution of at least 1024 x 768 to play properly.

This is a text-based game, or interactive fiction, which bridges the
gap between videogames and books. This game is heavily inspired by
the early 80's late 70's computer game <i>Zork</i> and plays similarly,
though it's an entirely different game and most similarities are
allusions. The game is played by entering in commands in the field at
the screen bottom, though shortcuts are provided. For more info, 
just go to "help" by entering 'h' or 'help' at the main prompt.
