# Lethe
This holds the current iteration of a large text-based adventure game.
The final title is "Lethe".

To play, just run Lethe.jar. Make sure to keep the .jar executable 
together with the ambience, save, desc, effects, and img folders. You may
move the shortcut wherever you'd like, of course.

This is a text-based game, or interactive fiction, which bridges the
gap between videogames and books. This game is heavily inspired by
the early 80's late 70's computer game "Zork" and plays similarly,
though it's an entirely different game and most similarities are
allusions. The game is played by entering in commands in the field at
the screen bottom, though shortcuts are provided. For more info, 
just go to "help" by entering 'h' or 'help' at the main prompt.
