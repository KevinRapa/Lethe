        PAGE_LIST[1] = "Let me guess- you're already bored and ready to slam this book "
                     + "shut. Believe me, you are just like every other student of "
                     + "enchanting; naive, thinking you're exceptionally skilled. "
                     + "Perhaps you are. But more than likely, you're not. Enchanting "
                     + "is not a mere hobby, or even an art, but a science. Magic is no "
                     + "such thing, for if it were, no one would understand it, and thus "
                     + "this book would not exist. Enchanting is closer to cooking than "
                     + "anything else... except perhaps baking, in that a strict recipe "
                     + "should be followed. As a student, you will fail many times from "
                     + "wrong or ill-prepared ingredients. Ninety-nine percent of the time, "
                     + "your failures will be anti-climactic and dull. In the unlucky one "
                     + "percent, you just might set fire to something or bend the fabric "
                     + "of space itself. As such, I persuade you to read this book.";
        
        PAGE_LIST[2] = "Most of all novice enchanting recipes require three or four "
                     + "ingredients. One of these ingredients is the 'subject' of the "
                     + "enchanting, or the primary ingredient. The rest are auxiliary, "
                     + "which serve to modify the subject. It is important that the subject "
                     + "be in the center of the table, with the auxiliary ingredients on "
                     + "the perimeter of the binding ring. Most enchanting tables will "
                     + "have a marker in the center, with a circle about 2 feet wide "
                     + "surrounding it. In general, the more perfect the circle, the better the "
                     + "table. Many artisan enchanting tables have been inspected and graded "
                     + "by this quality. To get straight to the matter at hand, the next "
                     + "step is the binding...";
        
        PAGE_LIST[3] = "The binding process is straightforward, but you must have a steady "
                     + "mind at this point. The bind must be done in one motion, without "
                     + "hesitation. You will be startled the first time. To execute the bind, "
                     + "with all ingredients properly in place, pound the table with your fists "
                     + "on the foci. The foci are etched circles on the front corners of the "
                     + "table. Pound firmly; as hard as possible without jostling the table. "
                     + "It is important that the ingredients not move. The enchant will be "
                     + "accompanied by a loud bang and a puff of smoke. The smoke is added "
                     + "to the table's mechanism as a special effect, and is actually "
                     + "uneccessary for a proper bind. This is the only plague of the science "
                     + "to date, for true enchanters do not yearn for superfluous effects.";
