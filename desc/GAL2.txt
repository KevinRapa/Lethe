This large circular adjoining room is three stories 
tall. You stand next to curved steps leading to a 
circular balcony supported by many pillars. In 
the room's center stands a huge statue, and an 
odd machine sits to the southeast Doors here lead 
south and east. Looking up, you see a glass dome 
at the top revealing the clear dark sky.
