You are now at a landing, about 20 feet below 
the surface of the balcony. The room extends 
east into a cellar-like area. Still surrounding 
you are the large granite block walls of the 
castle foundation. A hanging lantern lights the 
room dimly, and lingering dust particles fill 
the area with a thin haze.
