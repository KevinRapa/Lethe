You are in a cozy, tall chamber. A shale tile floor and 
granite walls surround you. In front of you is a small 
wooden table supporting a ceramic case and an ornate 
chair facing a large marble fireplace. To your right, 
a closed barred window lets in a small draft. A large 
tapestry consumes most of the wall behind you. In a 
dark corner is a desk with a glass orb on it coated in dust.
