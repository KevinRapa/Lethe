You've found your way into a smithy, dry and hot, 
which has been converted into a generic workshop. 
In the northeast corner is the forge accompanied 
by an anvil. Closer by is a kiln against the wall. 
At the south, a workbench against the wall sits 
below a row of cabinets in front of a window. 
Next to the workbench, closer to you, is a 
casting table and a small wooden barrel.
