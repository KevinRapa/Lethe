You're in the castle dining hall. The room is 
illuminated solely from the bright moonlight. 
You stand on its west side staring through a 
row of columns under its second floor balcony. 
You wonder at the room's grandeur. On its east 
end, a massive window spans the wall's width 
and both stories of the room. Twenty chairs 
sit around a long table on a carpet in the 
room's center below a white gold chandelier. 
On the north wall hangs a large tapestry. 
Below it, a set of stairs climbs against 
the wall to the balcony.
