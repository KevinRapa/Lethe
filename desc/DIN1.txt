This room is illuminated solely from the 
bright moonlight shining through a great 
window on the opposite end. 
You stand on its west side staring through a 
row of columns under its second floor balcony. 
You wonder at the room's grandeur. Twenty chairs 
sit around a long table on a carpet in the 
room's center below a white gold chandelier. 
On the north wall hangs a large tapestry. 
Below it, a set of stairs climbs against 
the wall to the balcony.
