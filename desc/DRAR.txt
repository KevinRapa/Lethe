The moment you enter the room, the first 
thing you notice is a ghostly white apparition 
sitting on the opposite end. It turns toward 
you, but there is no face you can recognize on 
it. The apparition sits at a bar on the south 
end of the room. There's a billiard table and 
chess table near a window on the east wall. A 
couch and low table sit on the west side. Next 
to you is an upright brown piano. This room is 
unlit save the bright moonlight shining in.
