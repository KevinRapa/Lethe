You find yourself in a laboratory filled with many 
alchemical devices. At the far east wall are a line 
of chemical dispensers. On a counter to the north is 
a confusing alchemical contraption with many glass 
tubes. On the same counter to the left is a metal 
sink next to a large pipe running from floor to 
ceiling. A tall buret sits on a table in the center. 
To the south stands both a shelf filled with chemistry 
tools and an unusual foam barrel.
