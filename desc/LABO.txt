You find yourself in a lab filled with many 
alchemical devices. On the far east wall is a line 
of chemical dispensers. On a north counter is 
a perplexing contraption of many glass tubes, 
a metal sink, and a large pipe running from floor 
to ceiling. A tall buret sits on a table in the 
center. To the south stands a tool-filled shelf 
and a foam barrel with smoke billowing out.
