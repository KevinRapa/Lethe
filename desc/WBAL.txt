You are on a square balcony at the front west 
corner of the castle. Littered all over the floor 
are pieces of wood and debris. In the center stands 
a tall beacon. To the west, the ocean follows a 
long cliff to a distant lighthouse. To your south, 
you look upon the dark forest you walked through to get here.
