You are on a square balcony at the front west 
corner of the castle. Littered all over the floor 
are pieces of wood and other debris surrounding a tall 
lit beacon in the center. To the west, the ocean follows 
a long cliff to a distant lighthouse. The south gives the 
view of the dark forest you walked through to get here.
