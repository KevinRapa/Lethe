This is the south end of a library. Above you is 
open save a second floor balcony. The room is well 
lit with spherical electric sconces. In the center 
of this area is an impressive statue of a galloping 
horse. Against the east wall is a staircase below a 
glass paned window. Against the south wall, below a 
huge portrait, is a bookshelf labeled "Creation". A 
couch sits just in front of a large pillar against 
the stairs.
