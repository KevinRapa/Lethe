You stand at the foot of a circular tower 
at the castle's eastern edge. As with 
the rest of the castle, the room is 
surprisingly clean, though dark. Only 
scattered moonlight penetrates the many 
stained glass windows following the 
room's circular staircase all the 
way to the top floor. Not but several 
feet from you, a female statue greets you.
