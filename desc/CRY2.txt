You stand at the north end of the chamber. 
Arranged in a grid pattern on the east wall 
are numerous drawers with knobs on each. 
Protrusions from the walls resembling boney 
arms hold up burning platters serving as 
wall lights. Standing against the west 
wall is a tall stone coffin with an 
engraving on the wall framing it. At 
the north wall is an altar.
