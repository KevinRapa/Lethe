These servants quarters are a mess. Facing west, 
a bed and table furnish the left of the room. The 
table is toppled over and the mattress is on the 
floor. On the right is a dresser searched thoroughly. 
Clothes and linens lie scattered on the floor. 
Under a window on the west wall sits an apparent 
elderly woman. She looks at you with an open 
stare and crazy grin while she laughs quietly to herself.
