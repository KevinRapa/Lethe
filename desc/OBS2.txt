This is a wide balcony opposite the large window 
to the west. At the north end is a second spiral 
staircase leading to a third floor balcony. A 
bookshelf stands beside a lounge chair to your 
right against the wall. A painting hangs on the 
wall above the lounge chair, and the area is lit 
by a small lamp resting on an end table.
