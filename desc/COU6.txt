You're in the northeast section of 
the courtyard, on the right side of 
the great set of steps. This area 
is mostly overgrown with thorns. 
In the center of this area is a 
crumbling statue. You can also 
barely make out a ruined stone bench 
You look to your right and spot an 
ghostly apparition leaning against 
the castle wall.
