You're in the northeast section of 
the courtyard, on the right side of 
the great set of steps. This area 
is mostly overgrown with thorns. 
In the center of this area is a 
crumbling statue. You can also 
barely make out a ruined stone bench 
hiding beneath the thorny growth. 
This area is just a nook beside 
the great set of steps and appears 
to lead nowhere. You look to your 
right and spot an ghostly apparition 
leaning against the castle wall.
