You have found the kitchen. This room's musty 
odor grows stronger near a pantry on the room's 
north end. A hearth for cooking sits in the room's 
center with pots hanging over it.  Aside the windows 
on the east wall is a shelf of wine and a couple 
open barrels. A counter extends along the west 
wall, with a metal sink on the end closest to 
you. Mounted on the south wall is the key rack 
mentioned earlier by the apparition.
