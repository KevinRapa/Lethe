You stand on a thin walkway hugging 
a wall inside a huge cistern. Only 
a few torches on the wall light the 
walkway. A large body of water spans 
outward from the walkway to the north 
before disappearing into darkness. The 
stagnant water is algae-covered and 
smells awful. A few visible columns 
protrude out of the water and extend 
upwards into a dark void. The walkway 
continues west before wrapping around 
the wall to the south.
