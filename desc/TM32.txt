You have made it to a small, irregularly-shaped 
chamber. There is a bit of space in which to move, 
but not much. Numerous small crevices dug into 
the walls hold lit candles. A casket leans against 
the east wall near a small ripped tapestry. Several 
vases lie scattered on the floor around the room's edges.
