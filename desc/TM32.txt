You have made it to a small, irregularly-shaped 
chamber. There is a bit of space to move around 
in, but not much. Numerous small crevices dug 
into the walls hold lit standing candles. A casket 
leans against the east wall. Several vases lie 
scattered on the floor around the room's edges. 
A small ripped tapestry hangs nailed to the north 
wall.
