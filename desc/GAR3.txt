You're at the southwest quarter of the garden 
overlooking the vast expanse of sea hugging the 
cliff to the south. Against the west railing is 
a long planter containing a bed of soil and a small 
variety of plants. To the northeast, in the garden's 
center, sits a fountain spouting water against the 
column supporting the glass dome. Behind you to the 
south is a small wooden utility chest.
