You have a feeling you've reached the other 
side of the castle. This room has the same 
sandstone floor and walls as the west wing. 
You stand on the west side of the room, which 
extends eastwards. On the west wall is an 
unsettling door. Directly across from you 
is a rack storing an assortment of weaponry 
below a barred window. Next to it is a tall 
basket storing more of the same. Wall torches 
are mounted on both the north and south walls.
