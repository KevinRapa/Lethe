You stand in a three-story observatory. A humongous 
window to west extends all the way up. A spiral staircase 
in a southeast nook leads up to a balcony. This room is 
dominated by a ring of statues, each resembling a diety. 
On the floor at the base of each is a brass slot. Against 
the east wall is an old telescope, likely nonfunctional. 
A long curved seat sits in front of the window on the west 
end next to a globe and standing lamp.
