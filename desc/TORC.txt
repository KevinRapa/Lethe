Many sinister tools fill this room. Center on the east 
wall is a vertical wheel with many pegs around the edge. 
Two sawhorses in the northwest corner support a long 
metal device. Against the south wall cross a pair of 
wood beams. A large scythe is displayed above it. In 
the center is a table fit with many leather straps. A 
couple cages hang from the ceiling, and two torches 
light the room on either side. A metal door leads east here.
