Many sinister tools and hanging metal cages 
fill this room. Center on the east wall is a 
vertical wheel with many pegs around the edge. 
Two sawhorses in the northwest corner support 
a long metal device. Against the south wall 
cross a pair of wood beams below a large scythe. 
A table in the center is fit with many straps. 
Metal doors go east and west here.
