You are in a symmetrical dome-shaped chamber. 
Everything is ornately carved from polished rock. 
There's a fountain in the center. At each diagonal 
below a spherical sconce is a glaring statue. 
Various hanging potted plants decorate the room. 
Straight up, there's a hole in the ceiling giving 
view to the sky. Only a single other door on the 
opposite side offers a way further. At the 
perpendicular ends are arched frames carved 
into the wall. This room smells quite awful.
