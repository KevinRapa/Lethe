You stand at the foot of the castle's 
well-fortified front gate. Behind you lies 
the long dark trail through the forest you 
took to get here. Ahead, the monstrous castle 
looms over you and appears most uninviting. 
Of course, you were invited here, correct? 
You ponder a moment, but you can't quite 
remember.
