You are on the north end of a 
dark, musty chapel extending to 
the south. A dusty haze clogs 
the air. Moonlight shines in through 
the stained glass windows above and 
pierces the haze faintly. This room 
seems fairly clean, though long 
abandoned. The walls are entirely 
wood and ornately carved. Rows of 
pews line either side of the room. 
Lit candelabras stand in each 
northern corner. A small cylix 
on an end-table to your west 
bears clear water. A long carpet 
runs between the pews to the far 
southern side of the chamber.
