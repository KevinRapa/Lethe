A balcony behind the castle extends to 
your east. A stone railing lining the edge 
sprouts columns which hold a roof over your 
head. The balcony is bare except for a sconce 
lighting it dimly and a stone bench to your 
left. Far below, there is an immense drop to 
the the sea where waves crash against the 
cliff. The sea extends northwards and to 
the west indefinitely, but to the east, you 
can see the village you left from behind a 
shoreline. Behind you on the wall is a 
small black button.
