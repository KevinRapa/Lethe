This looks like someone's office. It's built 
with the same sandstone as the rest of the west 
wing, but the floors are dark hardwood. On the 
west wall is a large portrait of a middle-aged 
bald man. To your north is a small fireplace. 
Sitting in the middle of the room is a fancy 
desk and chair on top of a carpet. Next to 
the east wall is a small bookcase and a couch. 
Behind you, aside the door, is a black iron lever.
