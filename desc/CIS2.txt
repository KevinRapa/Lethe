You are on the outer corner of the 
walkway. To the north and west, 
you see a body of water extending 
from the walkway into darkness. 
The bases of several columns 
protruding from the stagnant water 
are visible and reach into a dark 
void above. A canoe sits docked in 
the water here. The walkway 
continues to the south.
