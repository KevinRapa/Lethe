As your head rises above the hatch in the 
floor, you are stunned to see this room filled 
with technology that you have never encountered 
before. Many futuristic electronics are displayed 
on the floor. In the center of the room, a 
machine resembling an electronic cannon points 
into the central chamber. In a south corner, a 
bizarre helmet sits on a table. On the floor 
at the north end of the room stands a metal 
machine. On a table against the west wall is 
some kind of unknown apparatus.
