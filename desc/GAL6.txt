You are stunned to see this room filled 
with technology that you have never encountered 
before. In the center a machine resembling an 
electronic cannon points into the central 
chamber. A bizarre helmet sits on a table in 
a corner. On the floor at the north end of 
the room stands a metal machine. On a table 
against the west wall is some kind of 
unknown apparatus.
