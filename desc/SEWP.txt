You are on the other side of your cell 
door in a room with a large pool in the 
center. A vortex of water flowing from a 
tunnel to the north spins in the pool and 
drives a large submerged wheel attached to 
a driveshaft protruding from the ceiling. 
Several torches light the room. To your 
east is a second metal door.
