You are outside a large gateway, on which is 
inscribed "Abandon every hope, all ye who enter 
here." The gate is open; through it you can 
see a desolation, with a pile of mangled corpses 
in one corner. Thousands of voices, lamenting 
some hideous fate, can be heard. The way through 
the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at 
your attempts to pass.
