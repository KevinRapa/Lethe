You are at the junction of a large arched underground 
tunnel. A stone walkway leads west and east following 
a raging river of water against the north wall. A short 
bridge leads north across the river to a door. The river 
forks here; one half curving south down the side tunnel 
to the pool and the other leading further east. A second 
short bridge to the east gives access to the walkway 
opposite the fork. Running along the ceiling is a metal pipe.
