You find yourself in a small, one-story room adjoining 
a larger round room. The room is brightly lit with 
electric lights and the wall is tiled green and purple. 
The area is filled with paintings and sculptures of 
Asian origin. Other pieces include a katana displayed 
over a hearth on the south wall and an armor suit 
against the north wall. A screen stands in the corner 
of the room. One sculpture dwarfs the rest; a snake-like 
dragon displayed against the west wall.
