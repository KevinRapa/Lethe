You stand at the south end of a long chamber 
extending north. Before you stands a tall 
statue of a cloaked skeleton. Protrusions 
resembling boney arms hold up burning platters 
serving as torches all along the west wall. 
Arranged in a grid pattern on the east wall 
are numerous drawers. A deathly scene is 
carved on the southern wall.
