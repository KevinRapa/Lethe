You stand at the south end of a long chamber. 
Before you stands a tall statue of a cloaked 
skeleton. Protrusions from the walls resembling 
boney arms hold up burning platters serving 
as torches. Arranged in a  grid pattern on 
the east wall are numerous drawers with knobs 
on each. On the south wall is a carving of a 
depiction of death. This room extends to north.
