You have made your way to the highest area of the 
observatory. Here, a balcony follows the large 
multistory window around the perimeter of the room 
from the north to the south wall. A large chandelier 
hangs in the center over a two-story drop. Two 
telescopes stand on opposite sides of the balcony 
facing orthogonally. You can see a chest on the far side.
