The huge dim foyer is sparsely furnished and 
clean. Despite the openness, you feel claustrophobic. 
A red carpet is neatly laid out in the center. To 
your west, % To your east, a heavy wooden door 
leads somewhere else. A long wood table sits in 
the room's center under a huge chandelier and 
next to the front door is a lavender armoire. 
This room extends further north to a curved 
staircase at the other end.
