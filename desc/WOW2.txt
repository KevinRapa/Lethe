You are on the east side of a large two-story room. 
Right before you is a crumbled down staircase 
which once led to a balcony above you. There's 
a boarded up door on the east wall of this room. 
To your west, a suit of armor stands against the 
wall next to a large hearth. Through a window to 
the south, you can see out the front of the castle.
