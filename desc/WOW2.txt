You are on the east side of a large two-story room
before a crumbled down staircase which once led to 
a balcony above you. There's a boarded-up door on 
the east wall of this room and it doesn't appear
openable. A suit of armor stands west against the 
wall next to a large hearth. Through a window to 
the south, you can see out the front of the castle.
