You have made your way into the west end of a 
large bedroom. On the far eastern side, you can 
see a % body laying on a bed. On your side of the 
room, a mirror furnishes the north wall and a tall 
display cabinet stands against the south wall. Next 
to the mirror is a lever. A large lavender carpet 
lies on the floor.
