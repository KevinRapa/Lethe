You have made your way into the west end of a 
large bedroom. On the far eastern side, you can 
see a % body laying on a bed. On your side of the 
room, a mirror and wardrobe furnish the north wall. 
A wood chest and tall display cabinet stand against 
the south wall. A large lavender carpet lies on the 
floor.
