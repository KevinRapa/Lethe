This is a second-floor loft overlooking a parlor. 
A thin flight of steps leads down. The room is cast 
in a warm glow from a hanging light helped by a 
fireplace below. The walls and floor are all sandstone 
here. The loft is mostly bare save a piano sitting 
on a balcony extension. A couple barred windows to 
the north on opposite sides of a bookshelf give view 
outside. To the west, another door leads further 
into the castle depths.
