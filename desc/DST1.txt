You step into a tiny dark chamber of cobblestone. 
Only a single hanging lantern lights the ceiling. 
In the center of the room, a set of spiral stairs 
winds downwards into darkness. The air in here is 
heavy and turgid, and you hear only a deep whirring. 
A sharp incurring sense of dread overcomes you.
