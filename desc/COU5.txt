You're in the southeast section of 
the courtyard. A crumbling fountain 
is erected at the center of this area. 
A helmed female statue stands in its 
center. Barely visible at your feet 
is a tiled walkway surrounding the 
fountain. Unkept bushes line the 
castle walls to the south and east, 
and a tall spruce tree in the corner 
towers over you.
