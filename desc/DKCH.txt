You have entered a small sleeping chamber no 
more than 7 or 8 feet wide. The ceiling arches 
to the floor on one side, and a shaft spins near 
the ceiling at the north end. A rudimentary bed 
is on the room's south side, and a plain desk and 
chair sit at the east. There is a lit candle on 
the desk.
