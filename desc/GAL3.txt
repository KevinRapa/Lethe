Many sub-Saharan African artifacts and masks 
decorate this wing of the gallery. The most 
notable piece is a tall wooden totem standing 
against the room's west wall. A big stringed 
instrument is displayed above another hearth 
on the south wall. Above you and to the north 
is an open hatch leading to the next floor up. 
A ladder protrudes down through the hatch and 
is suspended above the floor by a rope holding it up.
