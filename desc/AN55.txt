You are at the north end of a long chamber 
with a low arched ceiling a mere foot above 
your head. This is clearly a tomb- an important 
one most likely. Your gaze is immediately drawn 
to something... somebody standing on the far 
south end. A large stone casket lies in the 
center of the long chamber. Several other 
wooden caskets stand up against the walls. 
A few torches on the walls light the room.
