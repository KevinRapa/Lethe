A balcony behind the castle extends to 
your west. A stone railing lining the edge 
sprouts columns which hold a roof over your 
head. The balcony is bare except for a sconce 
lighting it dimly. Behind you is an intriguing 
door. Far below, there is an immense drop to 
the sea where waves crash against the cliff. 
The sea extends northwards and to the west 
indefinitely, but to the east, you can see 
the village you left behind a shoreline.
