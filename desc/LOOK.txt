You stand on a square balcony tucked into 
the side of the castle. The balcony is bare 
except for a valve on the wall behind you and 
a railing at the other end. Far below, the sea 
extends westward alongside a cliff to the south 
of the castle. In the far distance, you spot a 
lighthouse. Behind you, aside the door, is a 
black iron lever.
