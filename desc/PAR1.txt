A large southern fireplace lights the lower 
parlor, but gives off no heat. A harp and 
cushion sit right before it. The upper balcony 
extends over into the parlor on several pillars 
above a few lounge chairs and a curious glass 
orb. At the northwest corner is a door guarded 
by an icy barrier. A wood shelf stands at the 
east, and on the west side is a table bearing 
a number of etched runes and letters.
