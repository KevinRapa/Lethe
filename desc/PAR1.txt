A large fireplace on the south wall lights the 
lower parlor, but gives off no heat. The upper 
balcony extends over into the parlor on several 
pillars. Below it, a few lounge chairs sit around 
a curious glass orb. At the northwest corner is a 
door guarded by an icy barrier. In the open area 
of the parlor sit a harp and cushion on a persian 
rug before the hearth. A wood shelf stands at 
the east, and on the west side is a table bearing 
a number of etched runes and letters.
