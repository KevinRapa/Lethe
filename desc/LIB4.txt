At the top step of the stairs, you gaze into the 
north end of the second floor. A couch sits in front 
of a fireplace in the far corner. A glimmering object 
catches your eye on a table between them. A west bookshelf 
labeled "Perdition" stands against the wall. In the 
northeast corner is yet another statue. A large globe 
stands in the room's center. The floor extends south 
on a small balcony.
