You have made it to a small, irregularly-shaped chamber. 
There is a bit of space to move around in, but not much. 
It is lit by a hanging iron bowl of fire hanging from 
the ceiling. Several vases sit scattered around the 
edges of the room. Leaning against the north wall 
is a standing casket. Hanging on the west wall 
is an unsettling.. effigy or idol.
