You have made it to a small, irregularly-shaped 
chamber lit by a hanging bowl of fire. There is 
a bit of space to move around in, but not much. 
Several vases sit scattered around the edges of 
the room. Leaning against the north wall is a 
standing casket, and on the west wall hangs an 
unsettling effigy.
