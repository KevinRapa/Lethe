You wake up in a noisy chamber. A torch on 
the north wall lights the room just dimly 
enough to see. A water wheel spins on an 
axle spanning the length of the room. To 
the east is a metal door with a small window 
to see through. Under the door is a shallow 
dip through which a river of water runs. The 
river flows through the room and under the 
water wheel before depositing down a grate 
in the far southwest corner. Various other 
gears can be seen spinning in the room.
