You step into a dimly lit cobblestone 
chamber with a low arched ceiling. Right 
away, you are surprised by a skeleton 
lying at your feet! Facing east, a large 
wooden shelf and a barrel sit against the 
opposite wall. Against the wall on your 
left sits a workbench and stool. Behind 
you are various sacks of material. On 
the floor in the back left corner is a 
ladder leading down below.
