This side is two stories high. A north 
set of stairs leads up to a small balcony. 
A tall cabinet and weapon rack accompany 
a window on the south wall. The far east 
end of this area is rounded and contains 
a great fountain spouting clear water. A 
soldier statue stands on the fountain. 
Torches are mounted on both the north and 
south walls.
