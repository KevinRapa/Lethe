This side of the east outer wall is two 
stories high. Against the north wall is a 
set of stairs leading up to a small balcony 
and a room suspended above the west side of 
this chamber. On the south wall is a barred 
window and a rack of weaponry below it. A 
tall cabinet stands to its east. The far 
east end of this area is rounded and contains 
a great fountain spouting clear water. A 
soldier statue stands on the fountain. A 
torch is mounted on both the north and 
south walls of the room.
