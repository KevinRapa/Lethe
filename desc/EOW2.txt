This side is two stories high. Against 
the north wall is a 
set of stairs leading up to a small balcony. 
On the south wall is a barred 
window and a rack of weaponry below it. A 
tall cabinet stands to its east. The far 
east end of this area is rounded and contains 
a great fountain spouting clear water. A 
soldier statue stands on the fountain. A 
torch is mounted on both the north and 
south walls of the room.
