You step out of the castle's front wall 
and into the forest. A ray of sunlight 
finds the back of your neck, and you feel 
warmth. At the same time, scattered light 
penetrates the forest canopy and illuminates 
your path. You continue treading away 
from the castle, but not too quickly, 
for you almost feel as though you are 
being accompanied, but you are not afraid.
