You have made it to a small, irregularly-shaped chamber. 
There is a bit of space to move around in, but not much. 
An inexplicable ball of blinding light hovering in the 
chamber's center illuminates the room. You can barely 
keep your eyes on it. Leaning against the north wall 
is a standing casket. Scattered around the room's 
edges on the floor are a few vases.
