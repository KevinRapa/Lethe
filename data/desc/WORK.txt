You've found your way into a smithy, dry and hot, 
which has been converted into a generic workshop. 
In the northeast corner is the forge accompanied 
by an anvil. Closer by is a kiln giving off a 
generous amount of heat. Some storage arranged 
on the south wall includes a workbench, 
row of cabinets, and a wood barrel. Beside a 
southern window is also a metal casting table.
