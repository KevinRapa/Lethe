This room has been ravaged. Clothes and linens from a 
nearby dresser have been tossed over the floor. A 
grinning elderly woman sits under a west window, 
perhaps the one who's to blame. She stares at you from 
across the room with a crazy grin. The mattress from a 
bed here has been thrown on the floor, and a toppled 
over table lies in the center.
