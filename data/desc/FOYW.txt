You are in a wide, two-story hall. The 
whole room is coated in the orange glow 
of a several torches standing around the 
room. Everything appears to be made of 
sandstone. Looking westward, three pillars 
on each side show the way to an odd door 
down a short ramp on the opposite end. 
Between each pillar is a statue, and 
behind you on the wall next to the foyer 
gate is a small black button.
