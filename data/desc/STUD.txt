This looks like someone's office, built 
with the same sandstone as the rest of the 
wing, but with floors of dark hardwood. On the 
west wall is a large portrait of a middle-aged 
bald man. Sitting in the middle of the room is 
a fancy desk and chair on a carpet before a 
small crackling fireplace. East is a small 
bookcase and a couch. A black lever has been 
mounted aside the door here.
