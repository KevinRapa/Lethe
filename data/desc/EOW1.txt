This room has the same sandstone floor and 
walls as the west wing. You're on its west 
side which extends east into an open area. 
A set of double doors with a skull engraving 
leads west. Directly across from you is a 
rack storing an assortment of weaponry and 
a tall basket below a window. Wall torches 
are mounted on both the north and south walls.
