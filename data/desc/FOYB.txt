This is a balcony behind the castle extending 
east. A stone railing lining the edge 
sprouts columns holding a roof. It's bare 
here except for a sconce 
glowing dimly above a stone bench. Far 
below, an immense drop meets 
the sea where waves crash against the 
cliff. The ocean extends northwest 
indefinitely, but east, you 
can see your village beyond a 
shoreline. Behind you on the wall is a 
small black button.
