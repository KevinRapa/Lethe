This is a balcony behind the castle extending 
east. A stone railing lining the edge 
sprouts columns which hold a roof over your 
head. The balcony is bare except for a sconce 
lighting it dimly and a stone bench. Far 
below, an immense drop meets 
the sea where waves crash against the 
cliff. The ocean extends north and 
the west indefinitely, but east, you 
can see the village you left from behind a 
shoreline. Behind you on the wall is a 
small black button.
