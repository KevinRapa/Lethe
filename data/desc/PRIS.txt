You are in a room with 6 prison cells lining 
the east and north. Metal doors lead both west 
and east. A large wooden table sits In the 
center of the room. Several scattered standing 
candelabras give a low level of light, just 
enough to see an sitting figure in cell 2. 
Against the north wall is a simple wooden cabinet.
