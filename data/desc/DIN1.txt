This room is illuminated solely from the bright 
moonlight shining through a great window on the 
opposite end. You stand under a second-floor 
balcony staring through a row of columns. You 
wonder at the room's grandeur. Twenty chairs 
sit around a long table on a carpet in the 
center below a white gold chandelier. On the 
north wall hangs a large tapestry above a 
staircase leading to the balcony.
