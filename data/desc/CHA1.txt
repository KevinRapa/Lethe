You are on the north end of a 
dark, hazy chapel extending 
south. Moonlight shines in through 
the stained glass windows above and 
pierces the haze faintly. Rows of 
pews line either 
side of the room. Lit candelabras 
stand in each northern corner. A 
small cylix on an end-table to your west 
bears clear water. A long carpet 
runs between the pews to the far 
southern side of the chamber.
