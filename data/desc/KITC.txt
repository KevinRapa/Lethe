This room's musty odor grows stronger near a 
pantry on the north end. A hearth for cooking 
sits here under a pot rack. Aside the window 
on the east wall is a shelf of wine and a 
couple open barrels. A counter extends along 
the west wall, with a metal sink on the end 
closest to you. Mounted on the wall here is 
the key rack alluded to earlier.
