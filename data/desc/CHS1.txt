This is the bottom of a circular tower at 
the castle's eastern edge. As with the rest 
of the castle, the room is surprisingly 
clean. Only scattered moonlight penetrates 
the many stained glass windows following a 
circular staircase all the way to the top. 
A female statue here greets you with a sad 
expression.
