This is a second-floor loft overlooking a parlor. 
A thin flight of steps leads down. The room is cast 
in a warm glow from a hanging light helped by a 
fireplace below. The loft is mostly bare save a 
piano sitting on a balcony extension. A couple 
barred windows to the north on opposite sides of 
a bookshelf give view outside. The only other door 
here is west.
