You're in the center of an overgrown courtyard, 
just in front of the main gate, surrounded 
on all sides by the fortress-like castle wall. 
A great set of crumbling steps climbs before you 
to the castle's entrance. There is a fork in the 
path here. It wraps left and right around to the 
sides of the steps. Ivy grows rampantly on and 
over everything and ravens dart through the air 
every now and then.
