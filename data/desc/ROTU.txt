You are in a fetid domed chamber of carved, 
polished rock. Glaring statues and spherical 
lights protrude from the walls at each diagonal 
and surround a central fountain. Low-hanging 
potted plants decorate the room also. A hole 
bored through the ceiling's apex reveals the 
night sky. Decorative arches are carved into 
the wall in each direction, but only your 
side and the opposite have doors.
