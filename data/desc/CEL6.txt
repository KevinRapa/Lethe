This is a suspended iron platform at the base 
of the ladder, perhaps some 50 feet below the 
cellar. There are no walls here, only a railing 
and four metal bars holding the platform to the 
ceiling. All you see is blackness and couple huge 
distant columns holding up the ceiling. An open 
metal pipe feeding down the above hole drains 
here. There is an obvious valve on the pipe. 
Looking below, you can see the glow of a few 
lights.
