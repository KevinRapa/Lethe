To your surprise, this chamber is not lavish 
as you expected. It looks quite abandoned. 
The room is dark with a low ceiling, and 
you can barely see a thing. The weak light 
shining in from the gallery illuminates a 
glass display in front of you. Cobwebs cover 
an unlit chandelier hanging above it. In a 
corner to the west stands a curio cabinet.
