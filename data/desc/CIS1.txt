You stand on a thin east-west walkway hugging 
a wall inside a huge fetid cistern. Only a few 
torches on the wall light the walkway. A large 
body of stagnant, algae-covered water spans 
outward from the walkway to the north before 
disappearing into darkness. A few visible columns 
protrude out of the water and extend upwards into 
a dark void.
