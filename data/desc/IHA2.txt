You are on the south end of the sandstone hallway. 
Looking to the north, the hallway darkens and ends 
at a door on the other side. Just like in the north 
end, a suit of armor is displayed here looking out 
an open barred window on the hallway's east side. 
It hold a polearm in its gauntlet. Above you also 
hangs a steel bowl lit with fire.
