You are on the east side of a large two-story room  
before a crumbled down staircase below 
a balcony above you. There's a boarded-up door on 
the east, appearing unopenable. 
A suit of armor stands west against the 
north wall next to a large hearth. Through a south window, 
you can see out the front of the castle.
