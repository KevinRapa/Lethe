The tunnel terminates here at the north wall. The 
river following the east wall continues northward 
through a barred gate. On the west wall is a metal 
door next to a valve. The pipe on the ceiling bends 
west and leads through the wall directly above the 
door. Across a short bridge to the east is another door.
