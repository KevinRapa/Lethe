You have made it to a small, irregularly-shaped chamber. 
There is a bit of space to move around in, but not much. 
An inexplicable ball of blinding light hovering in the 
chamber's center provides light, and you can barely 
keep your eyes towards it. A casket stands against the 
wall here, and a few vases lie scattered on the floor.
