You stand at the east end of a 
most bizarre hallway. Looking 
to the west, the hallway 
enigmatically bends downward into the 
earth, and the curved floor leaves a 
nearby 'horizon', passed which you cannot 
see. A deep red hue emanates from below 
the horizon. You almost lose your sense 
of position and balance. Against the 
nearby wall sits a quite normal drawered 
end table and potted plant.
