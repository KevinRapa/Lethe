You find yourself standing in an empty circular room 
with a blue and white checkered floor. Looking up, 
the room is a few stories high with a circular balcony 
wrapping around the room one story up. Wide paned 
windows extend along the south and east walls. On 
the west side is a pair of imposing black iron doors. 
Sitting in the center of a room is a pedestal.
