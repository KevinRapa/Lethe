You are at the bottom of a square pit, about 
8 feet across. You can see a hanging bowl 
of fire high above, however barely any light 
reaches this area. The walls and floors are 
cold stone brick, and it feels as though the 
floor is covered in straw. The skeleton of a 
forgotten soul rests on a sharp iron spike in 
the room's center.
