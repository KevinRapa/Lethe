The torch lights the room just enough to see. 
The room is in ruins and smells of algae. 
Its floor has warped with the underlying soil 
over time and has partially collapsed. 
You stand near the west wall on a 
slightly raised stone platform overlooking 
many books and piles of wood littering the 
floor. An unlit iron chandelier hangs from 
the ceiling.
