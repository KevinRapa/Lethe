You find yourself trapped by tall granite walls in 
this small chamber aside the foyer. An ornate chair 
and small wooden table on the shale floor are before 
a large marble fireplace. There is a ceramic case on 
the table. To south, a closed barred window lets in 
a small draft. A tapestry consumes most of the east 
wall, and in a dark corner is a dusty glass orb 
on a tenuous wooden desk.
