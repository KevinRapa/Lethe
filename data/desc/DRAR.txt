A ghostly white apparition sits on the south 
end of this room at a bar. There is no face you can 
recognize on it. There's a billiard table and 
chess table near a window on the east wall. A 
couch and low table sit on the west side. Next 
to you is an upright brown piano. This room is 
unlit save the bright moonlight shining in.
