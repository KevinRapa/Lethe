You are on the first floor of an open 
atrium. The walls and ceiling are all 
paned glass. The moon is beginning to 
fade and the first glint of day will 
appear soon. A curved black iron 
staircase suspended from the ceiling 
in the room's center leads further up 
to a balcony. A large 
black statue stands surrounded by the 
staircase. Many plants, well alive, 
decorate the atrium.
