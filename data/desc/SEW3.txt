You are at the junction of a large arched underground 
tunnel. An east-west stone walkway follows a raging 
river of water against the north wall. A short bridge 
leads north across the river to a door. The river 
forks here; half curving south down the side tunnel 
to the pool and the other leading further east. A second 
eastern bridge gives access to the walkway opposite the 
fork. A metal pipe runs along the ceiling.
