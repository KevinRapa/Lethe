Here is the west side of the large chamber, 
on the other side of the hearth. Across from you, 
a cart lies broken on the floor next to another 
window. Various cleaning tools litter many 
shelves around the room, and undoubtedly this area's 
primary purpose was that of utility. The only doors 
here are to the west, leading outside, and north.
