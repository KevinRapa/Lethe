You step into a dimly lit cobblestone chamber 
with a low arched ceiling. There is a skeleton 
here lying at your feet. A large wooden shelf 
and barrel sit against the east wall. Against 
north wall sit a workbench and stool. Behind 
you are various sacks of gardening material. 
On the floor in the back left corner is a 
ladder leading down below.
