The balcony here extends to 
your west. A stone railing lining the edge 
sprouts columns holding a roof. The balcony 
is bare except for a dim glowing sconce. 
Behind you is an intriguing 
door. Far below, there is an immense drop to 
the sea where waves crash against the cliff. 
The sea extends northwest 
indefinitely, but to the east, you can see 
the village you left behind a shoreline.
