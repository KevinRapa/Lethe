You're in the small north end of the library directly 
under the upstairs floor. In the northwest corner, a 
couch sits in front of a fireplace. Against the west 
wall is a slightly displaced bookshelf labeled 
"Voyage". East is a second bookshelf labeled "Warfare". 
Aside the fireplace is a small rack of shoes below a 
glass pane window and a statue.
