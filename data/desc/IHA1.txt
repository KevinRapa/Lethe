You are on the dark north end of a long hall 
resembling the antechamber you were in previously. 
The hallway extends southwards to a door on the other 
side. A suit of armor on the west wall is displayed 
opposite an open barred window to your left. In its 
gauntlet is a polearm. Hanging above is an unlit 
steel bowl. It looks like it's supposed to be 
lighting this end of the hall. Behind you, 
aside the door, is an iron lever.
