This is a tiny, prison-like bedroom, likely having 
been owned by a servant. The room is furnished with 
typical bedroom complements; a plain bed, wardrobe, 
and desk with a perfect lit candle on it. It pecks 
at your curiosity on who keeps them lit. A small 
barred western window offers a view outside.
