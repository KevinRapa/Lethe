You are further within the cellar to the 
west. The cellar continues north from here,
though terminating at a dead end a short way 
ahead. A hanging lantern lights the area 
dimly. The metal pipe curves onto the west 
wall and runs north. Another valve sticks 
from it. On the floor sits a wooden crate.
