The small secret chamber is filled with documents 
scattered all over. In the center of the room is 
an unkept desk and chair standing on a Persian rug. 
A large window spans most of the north wall. A scroll 
rack fills the west wall completely. A strange 
artifact sitting on a southern table emits light 
which reflects off an angled ceiling mirror onto 
the desk. A black safe sits under the table.
