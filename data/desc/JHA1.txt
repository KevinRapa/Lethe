You stand at the north end of a short hallway heading 
south. The walls are paneled in a polished wood and 
a jade-colored stone. A single window gives view 
outside on the north wall. This end is bare except 
for a painting hanging west and a jade lion statue 
standing against the east wall. A second one is 
displayed further down near a door on the far end. 
A couple lanterns hang from the ceiling.
