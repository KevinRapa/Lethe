You stand at the north end of a short hallway heading 
south. This room impresses you. The walls are paneled 
in a polished wood and a jade-like stone. A single 
window gives view outside on the north wall. This 
end's west wall is bare except for one painting, 
and a jade statue of a lion stands opposite against 
the east wall. A second one is displayed further 
down near a door on the far end. A couple lanterns 
hang from the ceiling.
