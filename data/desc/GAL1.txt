This is a small, one-story room adjoining 
a larger round room. The room is brightly lit with 
electric lights and tiled in a deviating green 
and purple. Paintings and sculptures of Asian 
origin are displayed about. Other pieces include a katana displayed 
over a hearth on the south wall and an armor suit 
against the north wall. A screen stands in the corner 
of the room. One sculpture dwarfs the rest; a snake-like 
dragon displayed against the west wall.
