This is a one-story room adjoining 
a larger round room east. The room is lit 
electrically and tiled green/purple. 
Asian paintings and sculptures are displayed 
about. A katana is displayed 
over a hearth on the south wall and an armor suit 
against the north wall. A screen stands in the corner 
of the room. One sculpture dwarfs the rest; a snake-like 
dragon displayed to the west.
