This is a square balcony tucked into the 
side of the castle. The balcony is mostly 
bare except for a trap door in the north 
east corner and a black lever on the castle 
wall. Far below, the sea extends westward 
alongside a cliff to the south of the castle. 
In the far distance, you spot a lighthouse.
