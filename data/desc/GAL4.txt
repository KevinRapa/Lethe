This is a circular balcony on the 
second floor. On the north side is a set 
of intricate double doors. To your west 
adjoins an open room beyond a pair of 
columns. On the room's west side is a tall 
metal machine resembling a modern radio 
and a protected case mounted to the wall. A 
floor above you to the west, you see a 
loft overlooking the large circular chamber.
