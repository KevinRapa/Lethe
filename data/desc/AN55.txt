You are at the north end of a long chamber 
with a low arched ceiling a mere foot above 
your head. This is clearly a tomb- an important 
one most likely. A large stone casket lies in 
its center, although several 
other wooden caskets stand up against the walls. 
Your gaze is immediately drawn to something... 
somebody standing on the far south end. 
A few torches on the walls light the room.
