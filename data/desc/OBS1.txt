You stand in a three-story observatory. A humongous 
western window extends all the way up. A long, curved 
seat next to a globe and standing lamp sits before the 
grand window. A spiral staircase in a southern niche 
leads up to a balcony. This room is dominated by a ring 
of statues, each resembling a diety, with a brass slot 
in the floor at the base of each. At the east wall sits 
an old telescope, likely nonfunctional.
