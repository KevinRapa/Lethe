You wake up in this dimly-lit, noisy chamber 
filled with spinning gears and a large spinning 
water wheel on an axle in the center. A torch on 
the north wall lights the room just enough to see. 
An windowed east metal door offers a view outside. 
Under the door, a shallow stream flows under the 
wheel and down a grate in a corner.
