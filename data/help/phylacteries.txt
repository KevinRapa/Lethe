In Zork, your primary objective as an explorer was to collect treasure. You may do the same here, but seeing as you are in a more dire circumstance, you primary job is to collect phylacteries (of which there are 5). As a secondary objective, you can raise your score by adding valuable items to the loot sack (If you can find it!).
