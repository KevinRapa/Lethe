You may examine things you enounter by entering an appropriate verb ("examine", "look at", etc.) followed by the thing you wish to examine. The shortcut for this is "c" for "check" (e.g. "c the window"). If the default action for furniture is set to 'examine', then entering just the name of the furniture will examine it too (Set this in 'options'). You may find this command useful in order to reveal clues about hidden objects as well as to add color to your imagination. You may examine items in your inventory the same way, but remember that furniture in the room will be prioritized first, so if there is both a sack in both the inventory and room, the game will think you mean the sack in the room!
