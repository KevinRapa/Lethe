You can combine 2 or 3 objects into a new object if they are combinable. Combining is done from the inventory. The syntax is two or items or slots separated by commas. As a shortcut, you can enter "combine" or even just "combine <item,item(,item)>" from the main prompt. Be careful, typing "combine the sword and handle" from the main prompt doesn't work because the game thinks anything after 'and' is a second command. However, preceding 'and' with a comma would work: "combine the sword, and handle", or "combine sword, handle". Combining is done all at once. Thus, if a hilt, pommel, and blade are combined to make a sword, do not try to combine 2 of them and then the 3rd later; combine all 3 at the same time. Though when following a recipe, sometimes it requires multiple combine actions in order to finish the recipe. In other words, sometimes crafted items are ingredients for other crafted items.
