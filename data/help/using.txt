You may use items directly from the main prompt. For instance, "break the door with the axe" or "drop 1, 4, and 6". When using items this way, you can enter in its name or the slot it's in. Note that you don't need to enter in the WHOLE name. For instance, if you are carrying a book called "guide, "Not Dying for the Unlearned", you may reference it by the name "guide". Be careful though, since if you are carrying multiple guides, the first one will be prioritized.
