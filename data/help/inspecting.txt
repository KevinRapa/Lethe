Items may be examined in the same way furniture are. Inspecting is done from the inventory, however you may type "examine <item>" or even just the item slot from the main prompt as long as you are carrying the item. You may also substitute the item's slot number as an alternative to its name. Take note that entering in the complete name of the item is not always necessary. Inspecting can also be done during a search if you want to look at an item before picking it up. Inspecting can be useful for discovering hidden information about items, and it may clue you into the next course of action.
