Whenever you enter an area, the description for it is automatically displayed. You will find this useful on a continual basis, for this is a text-based game, so there are more-or-less no pictures. You may interact with things you read in the description, barring some indistinct nouns such as "atmosphere", "the room", and "east". For your convenience, you may enter "map" or "m" so view a modest image of your location in order to get a quick feel for the directions you may move to.
