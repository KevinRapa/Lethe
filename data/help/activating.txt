The somewhat famous (in the right community) 1977 text-based computer game "Zork" was known for its respectably sophisticated text parser. This game attempts to accomplish the same, and thus allows reasonable sentences to be entered for input in addition to the simple commands like "search desk" and "climb stairs". You may type things like "go to the north", "look inside the cabinet", and even chain commands together like "walk through the east door and then search the table". Take note that the game always thinks 'and' leads to a second command, UNLESS you precede it with a comma (e.g. "drop 2, 3, and 6"). If you previously referenced an object or item, you may use "it" or "them" instead of the name. For instance "open the window and then climb through it" is valid. You may interact with items in your inventory in the same way as an alternative to entering your inventory. Just remember, you can interact with items only if you're carrying them. A couple other things- entering just the name of furniture and nothing else implies examining. Also, be respectful and avoid profanity, for you are playing a high-class character in a sophisticated setting.
