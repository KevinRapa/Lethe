You can search by entering an appropriate verb ("search", "look in/around", etc.) followed by the thing you wish to search. You may use the shortcut key "e" at your leisure (e.g. "e the table"). If the default action for furniture is set to 'search', then entering just the name of the furniture will search it too (Set this in 'options'). If the object can be searched, you will be taken to a sub-prompt for exchanging items with the object's contents. Remember that even if something cannot be searched, this doesn't imply that it doesn't contain useful stuff! When trading items with furniture, use the commands "take" or "store" (shortcut are "t" and "s") followed by a list of items (e.g. "take the pen, notepad, and 4"). Enter "loot" to take as many things as possible. You may also inspect things before you pick them up by entering the item's slot number.
